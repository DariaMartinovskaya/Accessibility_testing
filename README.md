# Accessibility testing

Accessibility testing is a type of software testing performed to ensure that websites, applications, and digital content are usable by people with a wide range of disabilities. This includes visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities. The goal of accessibility testing is to identify and resolve barriers that might prevent people with disabilities from accessing or using digital products effectively.

## Tools used for accessibility testing

Web accessibility evaluation tools are software programs or online services that help determine if web content meets accessibility standards.

<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/" target="_blank">Evaluation Tools Overview</a> - here you can find the information on more than 100 tools as well as the guidance on choosing tools.

#### WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools

WAVE is a suite of evaluation tools that helps authors make their web content more accessible to individuals with disabilities. WAVE can identify many accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) errors, but also facilitates human evaluation of web content. 

WAVE Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browser extensions are available for testing accessibility directly within your web browser.

## The largest web accessibility lawsuits 

#### $6 Million National Federation of the Blind v. Target Corporation

This case is as a precedent for web accessibility cases and a cautionary tale to industries that do not meet web accessibility standards. 

The National Federation of the Blind (NFB), a US non-profit organization representing blind individuals notified Target Corporation in 2005 of their website’s inaccessibility to the blind and filed a lawsuit in 2006. 

The lawsuit alleged Target of violating the California Unruh Civil Rights Act (California Civil Code Section 51 et. seq.), California Disabled Persons Act (California Civil Code Section 54 et. seq.), and The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)- accessibility laws that require businesses and any space to be accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. 

Target eventually settled the class-action lawsuit in 2018 and was required to pay damages of $6 million as well as make its website accessible to people with disabilities. Target also agreed to monitor its site’s accessibility by the National Federation of the Blind for three years and train its web developers team.

#### $1,575,000 National Association of the Deaf v. Harvard

One of the high-profile cases in web accessibility happened In 2015 when the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) filed a federal class-action lawsuit against the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University before the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. 

The association alleged Harvard and MIT of violating U.S. accessibility laws (the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 508) by not providing appropriately accurate and comprehensive captioning for online course materials (video and audio files). This simply denies people who are deaf and hard of hearing equal access to free online programming. 

A firm ruling from the courts ensures that university-sponsored online content is made accessible to people with disabilities moving forward. The NAD v. Harvard and NAD v. MIT lawsuits were each settled through consent decrees in February 2020. Here though, Harvard also was liable for the Class Counsel’s motion for $1,575,000 in attorneys’ costs and fees.

#### $755,000 National Association of the Deaf v. Netflix

In one of the first ADA website compliance lawsuits that established that accessibility should include online properties just as physical businesses, the National Association for the Deaf (NAD) filed a lawsuit against the online television and movie streaming giant Netflix in Massachusetts in 2012. This was to exempt customers with hearing impairments or deafness from their online services. 

Massachusetts’ presiding judge ruled in favor of NAD, stating existing online services were not exempt from ADA requirements. This changed the way Netflix operates ever since. A host of other businesses also align their operation policies around this rule. NAD and Netflix reached a settlement agreement that would have Netflix provide closed captions to all of their online streaming content within a two-year period. Netflix also had to pay $755,000 in attorney fees and costs.
